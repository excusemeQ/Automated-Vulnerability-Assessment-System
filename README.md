1.Problem Statement
Design and implement an AI-driven system that automates the assessment of vulnerabilities listed in the KVE catalog, providing actionable insights for cybersecurity teams.

2.Objectives
•	Develop a data pipeline to ingest and preprocess the KVE catalog data.
•	Implement machine learning models for vulnerability assessment and classification.
•	Create a user interface for interactive vulnerability analysis and reporting.

3.Project Components
Data Collection and Preprocessing
•	Data Source: KVE catalog CSV file from CISA.
•	Data Preprocessing:
o	Clean and format the data.
o	Extract relevant features such as CVE ID, description, severity, affected software, etc.
o	Handle missing values and ensure data quality.
Machine Learning Model Development
•	Feature Engineering:
o	Use NLP techniques to extract meaningful features from vulnerability descriptions.
o	Encode categorical variables like affected software.
•	Model Selection:
o	Choose appropriate supervised learning models (e.g., SVM, Random Forest, Neural Networks) for vulnerability classification.
•	Training and Validation:
o	Split the data into training and validation sets.
o	Train the models on labeled data (e.g., historical KVE data with known vulnerabilities and their characteristics).
o	Validate model performance using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.
System Integration
•	Backend Development:
o	Build a backend system that integrates data preprocessing, model inference, and result generation.
o	Implement APIs for data input and output.
•	Frontend Development:
o	Develop a user-friendly web interface for cybersecurity analysts.
o	Enable interactive querying of vulnerabilities, displaying assessed risks, and recommended actions.
Deployment and Testing
•	Deployment:
o	Deploy the system on a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP) to ensure scalability and accessibility.
o	Containerize components using Docker for easy deployment and management.
•	Testing and Evaluation:
o	Conduct thorough testing to ensure the system performs accurately and efficiently.
o	Use simulated data or historical datasets to validate real-world applicability.

4.Deliverables
•	Automated Vulnerability Assessment System: A deployed application that automates the assessment of vulnerabilities from the KVE catalog.
•	Documentation: Detailed documentation covering system architecture, data flow, model selection rationale, and usage instructions.
•	Presentation: A presentation summarizing the project objectives, methodology, results, and future enhancements.
